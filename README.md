# Vue, Apollo, GraphCool App

> A preconfigured vue, apollo, and graphcool application.

## Setup Vue

``` bash
# install vue-cli
npm install --global vue-cli

# create a new project using the "webpack" template
vue init webpack my-project

# install dependencies
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Setup Apollo & GraphQL

``` bash
npm install --save apollo-boost apollo-server-express apollo-link-context vue-apollo graphql graphql-tools cors subscriptions-transport-ws apollo-link-ws lodash
```
## Add styling dependencies

``` bash
npm install --save bulma
npm install node-sass sass-loader
```

## Setup Back-End with GraphCool
### Installation
``` bash
npm install -g graphcool
```

### Create Server & Link it to Your Application
``` bash
graphcool init
```

Now set the HTTP end point in the apollo-client.js file to the graphcool Simple API link generated by your 'graphcoool init' setup. You can also look these endpoints up again later with the command:
``` bash
graphcool endpoints
```

### Create Your Initial Schema
Create your initial schema in the project.graphcool file and then push the changes to the graphcool server.
``` bash
 graphcool push
```

### Setup User Account Authorization
Open your GraphCool console
``` bash
 graphcool console
```

Click on the Integrations link in the menu and then enable the Email-Password Auth integration.

Do a pull request to your GraphCool server to bring down the schema changes that occurred from adding the Email-Password Auth integration.
``` bash
 graphcool pull
```
